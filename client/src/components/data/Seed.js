        bio: 'As Rone, Paris - bred producer Erwan Castex creates music that is both otherworldly and warm, marrying cinematic ambitions to sounds and ideas rooted in minimal and experimental techno.\nEstablishing a shimmering, melodic techno sound with his 2009 debut, Spanish Breakfast, his music gradually became more elaborately constructed and stylistically diverse.\nAlbums such as 2014\'s Creatures and 2017\'s Mirapolis featured guest appearances from Saul Williams, Bryce Dessner(the National), and Etienne Daho, while incorporating symphonic arrangements, trance elements, heartfelt balladry, and more.\nBorn in the Parisian suburb of Boulogne - Billancourt in 1980, he debuted his Rone project in 2007, co - producing several tracks with Italian techno artist Lucy.After attracting the attention of French producer Agoria, Rone was signed to the InFiné label in 2008, making his solo debut with the Bora EP.\nFollowing the single "La Dame Blanche", his debut album, Spanish Breakfast, landed on the imprint in 2009. In 2011, Castex moved to Berlin and recorded his sophomore effort, Tohu Bohu, a 2012 release that featured rapper High Priest from Antipop Consortium.The album\'s biggest single, "Bye Bye Macadam," hit in 2013 thanks in part to a virally successful animated video and a Juan Atkins remix, while that same year, the National hired Rone to provide soundscapes for their album Trouble Will Find Me.',

        name: "Rolling Stones",
        genre: "Rock",
        bio: 'It wasn’t that rock music didn’t exist before The Rolling Stones—it did. But it didn’t exist at quite the same scale, or with the same reach, or the same sheer attitude that made the Stones so seismic. You wonder if it had something to do with their otherness, as though the fact that the American sounds they emulated—blues, country, R&B—didn\'t belong to them made them both more reverential and more free to explore. Like excavations from an archaeological dig, the band’s best music played out like a conversation between present and past, finding fresh meaning and connections in sounds that feel classic, bygone. Mick Jagger once said he’d rather be dead than singing "Satisfaction" at 45. Certainly there were other artists of his generation who took the same attitude, figuratively and otherwise. Un-rock as it may be, The Rolling Stones decided to live.\nFormed in 1962 by singer Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards (Richards spotted Jagger carrying Muddy Waters and Chuck Berry records on a train platform), the band—which went on to include jazz drummer Charlie Watts and bassist Ron Wood, among others—became one of the spearheads of the British Invasion, bad boys to The Beatles’ teddy bears. They toyed with folk and psychedelia in the mid-\'60s ("Ruby Tuesday", "Mother’s Little Helper"), but always circled back to something grittier, darker, the "Under My Thumb"s and "Paint It Black"s.',

Blending disco, house and lush French melodies, the album achieved over 100 million streams globally.\n• The duo has an extensive collection of musical equipment.
